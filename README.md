# Project-Sign-Up-Form

This project was my first attempt at making a fully responsive webpage. 

Built using HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript.

I added JavaScript to check that the password satisfied certain conditions (ie. the strength of the password) and to show a corresponding error message if it did not. If the password strength is accepted it will also check to ensure that the confirm password value is the exact same.
